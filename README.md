# Important notes.

This project is part of a job application process and was build mainly on Svelte, TailWind and CSS.
Here I implement a map UI which dynamically shows the location of the componets on the left of the scree, reprecenting realstate rentals.

The locations pinned on the map are clickable and popup the realstate info, based on the data passed between components trough Svelte store
